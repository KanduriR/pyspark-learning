# pyspark-learning
In this repo, I've uploaded my PySpark scripts as I learn about the platform.

The data sets used are in the resources folder. And based on the type of API's used (structured/ unstructured)
for spark they are categorized into DF/RDD folders. The outputs of each script are within their respective folders.
